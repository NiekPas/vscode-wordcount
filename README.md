# VSCode - WordCount README
 
This is a fork of [microsoft/vscode-wordcount](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-wordcount) that supports counting the words in your current selection.

## Functionality

It's pretty simple, open up a `Markdown` file and the status bar will have an auto-updating wordcount in it. Selecting some text will show the number of words in your current selection.
